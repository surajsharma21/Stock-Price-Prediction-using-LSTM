# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
Predicting stock price using historical data of a company, using Neural networks (LSTM).

This project includes python programs to show Keras LSTM can be used to predict future stock prices for a company using it's historical stock price data. You can also find sample programs on how to fine tune Hyperprameters of LSTM (or any Neural Network for that matter).

## Here are the things we will look at :
- Reading and analyzing data. (Pandas)
- Normalizing the data. (SkLearn)
- Converting data to time-series and supervised learning problem.
- Creating model (Keras)
- Fine tuning the model
- Training, predicting and visualizing the result.
